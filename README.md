# MacOS clipboard manager

## Project information

This project was inspired by the Clipboard History (Clipboard Manager) feature in Microsoft Windows.

## Functionality

The core functionality is based on being able to view your MacOS clipboard history.

When you start the script, it listens for clipboard activity. Every time you copy something using **Command + C**, the script saves it. When you press **Command + Shift + V**, a dialog pops up displaying the last 10 copied items. Click on the text you need, press **Ok** and then paste it using Command + V.

## Running it on your device

### 1. Installing Git

If Git is not already installed on your system, follow the instructions below. Otherwise, you can skip this step.

- Install Homebrew with this command or visit their website for further information (<https://brew.sh>)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- Install Git with Homebrew, and check the version

```bash
brew install git
git version
```

### 2. Cloning the repository

- Open the terminal and run the following command to clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LorincziMatyas12/macbook-clipboard-history.git
```

### 3. Using the program (script)

- Make sure that python3 is installed on your laptop. If not follow the instructions on the official site: <https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/>
- You can also install python3 with Homebrew. Check the version with the following command

```bash
brew install python
python --version
```

- Run the following command to grant execute permissions to your user. You only have to do this once. (Navigate to the project folder with **cd** command, then you don't have to include the **/path/to/** in the following commands)

```bash
chmod u+x /path/to/clipboard_history.sh
```

You can list all the files in the project folder with **ls -l**, you should see something like **-rwxr--r--** permissions.

- Running the script: Each time you restart your computer, you will need to start the program manually.

```bash
nohup /path/to/macos-clipboard-history/clipboard_history.sh --start &
```

- Clear your clipboard history:

```bash
./path/to/clipboard_history.sh --clear
```

- To see the clipboard window run the following command:

```bash
./path/to/clipboard_history.sh --show
```

- Stopping the script:

```bash
./path/to/clipboard_history.sh --stop
```

### 4. Creating a Shortcut to View Clipboard History

- Open the **Automator** app on your Mac
- Create a **Workflow**
- Add a **"Run Shell Script"** action to the workflow
- Ensure the following setting is applied in the workflow:
  - **"Workflow receives 'no input' in 'any application'"**
- For **"Run Shell Script"**, set:
  - **Shell:** `/bin/bash`
  - **Pass input:** `to stdin`
- Paste the following command into the script box:

```bash
/path/to/clipboard_history.sh --show
```

- Click the **Play** button to test it. You should see the clipboard history window
- Save the workflow
